<h2>Learning Goals of this Project:</h2>
Students will get familiar with packet capture (PCAP) reading and some common man in the middle techniques. This is where a malicious user puts themselves in the middle of the conversation with another user or application and eavesdrops on all the traffic. Some papers which demonstrate this concept are the following:

<ul>
<li><a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=8344724">Man-In-The-Middle Attack in Wireless and Computer Networking- A review</a></li>
<li><a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1002/wcm.2527">Detection of man-in-the-middle attacks using physical layer wireless security techniques</a></li>
<li><a href="https://wenke.gtisc.gatech.edu/papers/iworm.pdf">On the Feasibility of Large-Scale Infections of iOS Devices</a></li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

Students will familiarize themselves with Layer 2 – 7 network traffic and how to analyze network traffic using Wireshark, a network protocol analyzer, and its libraries such as pyShark.

<ul>
<li>For more details about Wireshark you can visit <a href="https://www.wireshark.org">https://www.wireshark.org</a></li>
<li>For details about pyShark and tshark you can visit <a href="http://kiminewt.github.io/pyshark/">http://kiminewt.github.io/pyshark/</a></li>
</ul>
Students will also familiarize themselves with application layer protocols such as HTTP and IRC.

<ul>
<li>If you are not familiar with HTTP, we strongly recommend you learn about the protocol, methods, and requests. You can find a good introduction at <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Overview">Mozilla’s developer page</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/swlh/http-an-overview-of-web-development-4f6033efb9da">Sam Barros’ Medium page</a></li>
<li>IRC was a very common protocol in the early 2000s. For its simplicity and efficiency it’s still in use on multiple settings. Several Botnets use it for Command and Control (C&amp;C) and hacking groups still rely on IRC to exchange information. You can read more and get familiar by reading <a href="https://medium.com/the-complete-guide-for-irc-network-i-e-freenode/irc-introduction-and-its-main-ingredients-982cd3639a67">this Medium article</a>.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

Finally, this is a graduate course. So it is expected that students will research and understand how these network protocols work by reviewing their RFCs:

<ul>
<li>RFC1459 (Internet Relay Chat Protocol): <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1459">https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1459</a></li>
<li>RFC2616 (Hypertext Transfer Protocol): <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2616">https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2616</a></li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

&nbsp;

<strong><u>BACKGROUND</u></strong>

The Necrocryptors (TNC) is a hacking group known for multiple data leaks and has been active at underground forums selling personally-identifiable information (PII) and credit card data stolen from vulnerable websites.

Recently, TNC led a DDoS campaign against multiple targets in the United States, leading to a Federal Investigation by​​ the National Cyber Investigative Joint Task Force (NCIJTF). This investigation was coordinated by the FBI Cyber Crime division and after months of undercover investigation, NCIJTF was able to capture unencrypted communication between members of TNC. While NCIJTF did not disclose how this communication was captured, we can infer that either it came from an insider member of the organization or a sophisticated attack led by NCIJTF allowed this communication to be captured.

In this project, you are playing the role of Mark, an FBI agent from the Cyber Crime division.

You walk into the office, just back from a nice vacation in the Bahamas, and pour some coffee from the shared pot near your cubicle when you hear, “Mark! Great to see you are back! Come over to my desk right now, we need to talk.” It’s your boss, Bill. You think to yourself, <em>Geez! I just came back. This guy doesn’t give me a break.</em>

You take your coffee to Bill’s office, close the door and listen as Bill starts.

“Mark, I have a task for you. We finally got our hands on some incriminating evidence against TNC. With this pile of evidence, the Attorney General is on my neck to bring those guys to justice. But we need some strong evidence of criminal activity that can’t be disputed in court.”

“Okay…” <em>My wife told me to take some extra days off, but no. I had to come back today…</em>

“I’m sending the packet your way,” Bill says, “You have one week to analyze the data and find clear evidence of criminal activity. The Attorney General sent us a list of things they are looking for. It’s all on your desk.”

“Sounds good, boss. It’s great to be back.”

You leave his desk, take a sip of coffee and go back to your computer. <em>No time to slowly get up to speed</em>, you think, <em>but that’s OK. I’m excited to help take TNC down.</em>

<h1>Office Setup</h1>
&nbsp;

Ok, vacation is over. Now it’s time to configure your workspace and start the research.

You have two options to complete this assignment:

<ul>
<li>Install Wireshark into the VM; or</li>
<li>Create your own environment and install any tools needed.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

&nbsp;

<strong><u>This project does not require a lot of preparation. Just download wireshark, the provided PCAP file, and start analyzing.</u></strong>

&nbsp;

The next few pages will guide you on installing Wireshark on Windows, MacOS and Ubuntu setup.

&nbsp;

<h3><strong>Installing Wireshark – Windows

</strong>To install Wireshark on Windows, please go to: <a href="https://www.wireshark.org/download.html">https://www.wireshark.org/download.html</a>. Once there, you will see a page like this:</h3>
Click the correct Windows Installer (64-bit or 32-bit), depending on your OS.

&nbsp;

Here is an example of what the 64 bit option looks like while it’s downloading in the Chrome browser. (It may look different in your browser.)

&nbsp;

After the file finishes downloading, execute it and you will see the following screen:

&nbsp;

Just click “Next &gt;” on each page to install with default settings. Then you will see:

A new installation window, for Npcap, will then come up. Please continue through this Npcap installation as well to proceed with the Wireshark installation.

Once the Npcap installation is finished, the Wireshark installation should continue automatically. Once that installation is done, you will see the following:

&nbsp;

Click “Next” then “Finish.”

Congratulations! Wireshark is now installed on your computer!

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

<h3><strong>Installing Wireshark – Ubuntu</strong></h3>
Inside your Linux box, Open Terminal Emulator and run the following command:

<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td width="624">sudo apt install wireshark</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
&nbsp;

Type in the root password (debian) and “y” to download and install all required packages.

&nbsp;

During the installation, if prompted, answer “Yes” for the question: “Should non-superusers be able to capture packets?”

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Once the installation is complete, close the Terminal Emulator and locate Wireshark in Applications &gt; Internet &gt; Wireshark:

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Congratulations! You are all set now!

&nbsp;

<h3><strong>Quick Intro to Wireshark</strong></h3>
On the PCAP for this project there is a special IP address the Azure Wireserver which is 168.63.129.16 if you work on the azure platform you will have seen this IP address all the time for DNS, Health Probes and much more. Below we will use the IP and some wireshark filter commands to navigate through the PCAP. The command below:

&nbsp;

<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td width="624">&nbsp;ip.addr==168.63.129.16</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
&nbsp;

&nbsp;

If you would like to filter by a protocol and the IP address you would add the protocol before or after the IP address like the following:

&nbsp;

<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td width="624">ip.addr==168.63.129.16 and http</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
Similarly you can just put the protocol no IP address and that will show all source and destination traffic including that protocol.

Now you know the basics, I <strong>strongly </strong>recommend you review the Wireshark Guide at <a href="https://www.wireshark.org/docs/wsug_html_chunked/ChapterIntroduction.html">https://www.wireshark.org/docs/wsug_html_chunked/ChapterIntroduction.html</a> and the DisplayFilters section at <a href="https://wiki.wireshark.org/DisplayFilters">https://wiki.wireshark.org/DisplayFilters</a>.

&nbsp;

There are numerous videos on YouTube explaining basic Wireshark functionality. I recommend this one from Anson Alex: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkCSr30UojM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkCSr30UojM</a>

&nbsp;

<h3><strong>Python</strong></h3>
For this project, you will also need the Python interpreter which can be found here: <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">Python download page

</a>

For a guided walkthrough on installing dependencies and going over pyshark, please refer to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M70MBeymgjQ">Youtube Video from our IA Renan showing how to install dependencies for Flag 6 and a short example</a>

&nbsp;

For a guided walkthrough using VScode, please refer to the following document: <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/python-tutorial">Python tutorial</a>

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Good luck!

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

<h1>Task 1 (4 points):</h1>
<em>Your first task is to figure out where the hackers are spending their time and gather some evidence for the Attorney General. This will also give you a good overview of Wireshark filters.</em>

&nbsp;

The Attorney General needs some evidence of The Necrocryptors’ associates and where the group meets. For this, you need to gather the following information:

&nbsp;

<ul>
<li><strong>Task 1.1: What is the server address used by the hackers to communicate?</strong> <em>g.: irc.someplace.net (1 point)</em></li>
<li><strong>Task 1.2: What is the nickname of the malicious actors involved in this conversation ? Add the names in the order they appear in the conversation</strong> For the autograder, use the following format: <em>firstactor,secondactor,thirdactor (1 point)</em></li>
<li><strong>Task 1.3: What channel do they use to communicate?</strong> Hint: <em>Channel names always start with #, so include # in your answer (1 point)</em></li>
<li><strong>Task 1.4: What is the hash used by the malicious actor to validate its identity? </strong><em>(1 point)</em></li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

<h1>Task 2 (28 points):</h1>
<em>Your second task will require you to recover a payload from the conversation. There are multiple ways to do this. You can use Wireshark, pyShark or any other library available.</em>

&nbsp;

As part of the evidence gathering, the Attorney General needs concrete evidence of malicious intent. For Task 2, you will need to review the conversation between members of TNC and gather incriminating data from this conversation.

&nbsp;

<ul>
<li><strong>Task 2.1 : One of the hackers transfers a file to another hacker, after confirming their identity. What is the name of the file? </strong><em>(Including extension)</em> <em>(6 points)</em></li>
<li><strong>Task 2.2: It seems that the file transferred is encrypted. What encryption method or algorithm was used to encrypt the file? </strong><em>(Just the 3-letter name)</em> <em>(4 points)</em></li>
<li><strong>Task 2.3: If you decrypt and run the file, you’ll get a unique hash based on your GTID. What is the hash generated? </strong><em>(18 points)</em></li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

<h1>Task 3 (26 points):</h1>
The Attorney General lets you know that they think there is a web server in here that is phishy and is spitting out long numbers and letters. The Necrocryptors hacking group is known to play tricks with these values. The Attorney General needs the following information to track the folks operating the website:

<ul>
<li><strong>Task 3.1: The site domain name </strong><em>(Record just the site’s domain name and the top-level-domain (TLD) name, with the period. E.G: host-name.tld) (2 points)</em></li>
<li><strong>Task 3.2: The public IP address </strong><em>(2 points)</em></li>
<li><strong>Task 3.3: The primary nameserver for this TLD </strong><em>(You may need to look outside the pcap for this information. Think about tools that will give you the nameserver data for a specific domain) (6 points)</em></li>
<li><strong>Task 3.4: The hash provided by entering your Georgia Tech ID in the field </strong><em>(i.e. 9021042) (NOTE: The website is real and safe to access) (16 points)</em></li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

<h1>Task 4 (32 points):</h1>
The Attorney General is impressed by you but says they believe the group is also using another server to host a malicious file. It appears that one of the hackers recently accessed this server and downloaded a file from it.&nbsp; As a last minute request, the Attorney General is asking you to investigate what this file is, and where it is hosted.

<ul>
<li><strong>Task 4.1: What is the IP address for the server in question? </strong><em>(2 points)</em></li>
<li><strong>Task 4.2: What is the username used to log in the server? </strong><em>(4 points)</em></li>
<li><strong>Task 4.3: What is the password used to log in the server? </strong><em>(4 points)</em></li>
<li><strong>Task 4.4: One file is downloaded from the server, what is the file name? </strong><em>(3 points)</em></li>
<li><strong>Task 4.5: What is the programming language used to create this file?</strong><em> (The hackers are using a common encoding format to hide the real contents)</em> <em>(5 points)</em></li>
<li><strong>Task 4.6 If you run this file you’ll get a Combined hash. What is the unique hash for your GTID (i.e</strong><em> <strong>902042</strong></em><strong>) ? </strong><em>(14 points)</em></li>
</ul>
<strong>&nbsp;</strong>

<strong>&nbsp;</strong>

<h1>Task 5 (5 points):</h1>
Exhausted from the prior exercises, the attorney general has two more exercises for you to prove you belong here and that he shouldn’t fire you despite doing a good job. He mentions to you the hackers are getting smart and they have a website called &nbsp;that has absolutely nothing to do with Azure Firewalls but everything to do with web application firewalls. Apparently there are some weaknesses integrated into the website which allow you to get to different parts of the website something called a path traversal attack.

<ul>
<li><strong>Task 5.1: There is a flag labeled 5.1 that outputs a hash when you input in your GTID try to find the page and get the flag </strong><em>(2 point)</em></li>
<li><strong>Task 5.2 What is the directory name that contains the hint for 5.3? </strong><em>(1 point)</em></li>
<li><strong>Task 5.3: There is a flag labeled 5.3 that outputs a hash when you input in your GTID try to find the page and get the flag </strong><em>(2 points)</em></li>
</ul>
Suddenly, your phone rings. You see that the call is coming from Bill’ extension.You were ready to head back home and watch Netflix. Here we go again…

“Mark, great job so far! I was thinking here. This will not be the last time you will be doing this analysis on pcaps, so why don’t we start building a python class with several methods to automate some of the work for next time?”

“When you say we, you are say, why dont I build this class right?” you say.

“Of course not! I already created some skeleton code to help you out. You just need to build 3 functions now” Bill says.

“Oh, ok. Thank you Boss..”

As you hang up the call, Bill sends you via IM a zip file containing the python class and a attack pcap from a past incident so you can create the functions and test.

&nbsp;

<h1>Task 6 (15 points):</h1>
For this task, you need to use the provided <strong>pcapanalysis.py</strong> and <strong>TCP.reflection.pcap</strong> files to create three functions. The screenshot below shows where you need to code the functions and the expected output on each variable n. You can create as many functions and variables you need, however the provided functions need to return the expected output.

To start, make sure that the package pyshark is installed on your system. Please review pyshark Github page to install the package and its dependency (tshark) : <a href="https://github.com/KimiNewt/pyshark/">https://github.com/KimiNewt/pyshark/</a> and <a href="https://tshark.dev/setup/install/">https://tshark.dev/setup/install/</a>

When you open <strong>pcapanalysis.py</strong>, make sure <strong>student_id </strong>is updated with your 9-digit Georgia Tech id

Do not modify the import statements. All you need to complete this assignment is there. New imports may be ignored by the autograder and your code will fail. Completing Task 6.1 and 6.2 will grant you the remaining 5 points for the project. Task 6.3 is an extra credit of 10 points. Your maximum grade will be 110 points if you complete the entire project!

&nbsp;

<ul>
<li><strong>Task 6.1: Modify </strong><strong>def</strong><strong> syn_ack(self):function to return <em>n</em>, being <em>n</em> (int) the number of packets on <em>reflection.pcap</em> file that contains ONLY the <em>SYN+ACK</em> flags </strong><em>(3 points)</em></li>
<li><strong>Task 6.2: Modify </strong><strong>def</strong><strong> rst(self):function to return <em>n</em>, being <em>n (int)</em> the number of packets on <em>reflection.pcap</em> file that contains ONLY the <em>RST</em> flag </strong><em>(2 points)</em></li>
<li><strong>Task 6.3: Modify </strong><strong>def</strong><strong> victim_ip_port(self): function to return <em>d, p, </em>being <em>d</em> the IP address of the victim of the attack (string) in the <em>reflection.pcap</em> file and <em>p (int), </em>being the TCP port of the service being attacked. </strong><em>(10 points. Extra credit)</em></li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
